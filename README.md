# User bug reporting for Mobile C.

Any one who has found bugs on Mobile C can report it by pulling request or reporting issue in this repository.
If a bug is related to the language / compiler / runtime then source code attachment would be nice.
If bug is about the app itself, some descriptions with screenshot if needed would be nice.
